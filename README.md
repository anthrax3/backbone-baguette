backbone-baguette
=================

As a Backbone fanatic, I quickly noticed that I was running into the rewriting of a lot of similar code. I also did not wanted to use an on-top framework for small applications.
This project is highly inspired by Aura and Backbone Marionnette, but is aiming at smaller projects, which don't necessarily require all the great features provided by this kind of on-top frameworks.
