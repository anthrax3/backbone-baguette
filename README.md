backbone-baguette
=================

As a Backbone fanatic, I quickly noticed that I was running into the rewriting of a lot of similar code. I also did not wanted to use an on-top framework for small applications.
This project is highly inspired by Aura and Backbone Marionnette, but is aiming at smaller projects, which don't necessarily require all the great features provided by this kind of on-top frameworks.

TODO : Has to remove the Backbone.sync as it has been merged into the official repo
TODO : Be able to add loader:true to any Model or Collection View in order to display a -globally configurable- loader easily when models/collections are fetched
